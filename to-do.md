# Nami AI Project Checklist

## Bugs
- Mic randomly stops listening: The microphone input ceases to function intermittently without a clear error message.

## To-Do
- Implement true short-term memory: Create a system for Nami to recall context from the current conversation session.

- Implement long-term memory: Develop a persistent memory solution that allows Nami to remember key facts and user interactions across multiple sessions.

- Implement user profiles: Build a system to store and retrieve specific user data, including details like age verification and personal preferences.

- Moods: Design a state machine to dynamically change Nami's emotional state, influencing her responses and behavior.

- Build a simple "action queue" or goal system: Create a mechanism that allows Nami to proactively perform actions or initiate conversations.

- Figure out the daily context awareness: Develop a system for loading and utilizing context-specific information based on the current activity, such as the game being played.

- Vision system object recognition: Enhance the vision module to identify and react to specific on-screen objects and UI elements.

- Audio classifier for game sounds: Expand the audio processing capabilities to recognize and respond to specific in-game sound events.

- Ability to activate sound effects: Implement a feature that allows Nami to trigger pre-defined sound effects during the stream.

- 2D Avatar: Continue the development of the Live2D avatar for visual representation.

## Very Low Priority Items

- Ability to change Twitch stream title: Enable Nami to modify the stream title on Twitch via API calls.

- Ability to activate Twitch redemptions: Allow Nami to trigger custom Twitch channel point redemptions.

- Ability to participate in Twitch channel points predictions: Develop functionality for Nami to engage with Twitch's channel points prediction system.
