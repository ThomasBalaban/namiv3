User-Specific Context

    Tracks user preferences, past interaction summaries, and personalized settings.
    Example: user_<id>_history.json

    {
      "id": "12345",
      "name": "Timos",
      "preferences": { "favorite_color": "blue" },
      "conversation_history": [
        { "timestamp": "2024-11-30T10:00:00Z", "summary": "Discussed chatbot memory." }
      ]
    }

Botâ€™s Relationships

    Captures how the bot "feels" about users or its general attitude toward them.
    Example: bot_relationships.json

    {
      "relationships": {
        "12345": { "sentiment": "positive", "notes": "User enjoys technical discussions." }
      }
    }

Global Knowledge

    Stores shared facts or frequently referenced information.
    Example: global_context.json

    {
      "current_events": [
        { "topic": "AI advancements", "summary": "OpenAI released a new GPT update." }
      ],
      "common_facts": { "Earth_radius_km": 6371 }
    }

Session-Specific Context

    Tracks ongoing conversations or temporary variables.
    Example: session_<id>.json

{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "active_user_id": "12345",
  "context": {
    "current_topic": "chatbot design",
    "questions_asked": ["How do I manage memory?", "Is JSON viable?"]
  }
}

Key Considerations

    File Organization: Use directories for structured storage, e.g., /users/, /sessions/.
    Scalability: Use separate files for large datasets (e.g., one file per user or session) to avoid size limitations.
    Privacy & Security: Encrypt sensitive files and provide users with options to view or delete their stored data.
    Versioning: Include version numbers or timestamps to manage updates as structures evolve.

    {
      "version": "1.0",
      "data": { ... }
    }

By categorizing data into distinct files and managing it thoughtfully, JSON can serve as an effective solution for both historical and session-specific context management.
