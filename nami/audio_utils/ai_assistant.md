# Comprehensive AI Assistant Framework for Streaming

## Prioritization Framework

1. **Input Source Hierarchy**
   - Establish a dynamic hierarchy among inputs (e.g., direct address via microphone > twitch chat mentioning the bot > ambient sounds > visual changes)
   - Hierarchy can shift based on context rather than remaining static

2. **Contextual Relevance Scoring**
   - Score inputs based on relevance to ongoing conversation
   - Track recent topics to prioritize related new inputs
   - Example: If discussing music, music detected via hearing gets higher priority

3. **Interruption Thresholds**
   - Different input types need different "importance thresholds" to interrupt ongoing processing
   - Direct questions have low threshold (easy to interrupt)
   - Background observations have high thresholds (only interrupt if significant)

4. **Twitch Category as Contextual Framework**
   - Use Twitch streaming category to establish baseline context
   - Adjust priorities and response styles based on category (Just Chatting, Gaming, Reactions)
   - Fetch category-specific knowledge to inform responses

5. **Response Threshold System**
   - Implement a dynamic threshold that must be crossed for the AI to respond
   - Inputs are scored based on relevance, directness, and importance
   - Only trigger responses when score exceeds the current threshold

## Natural Conversation Mechanisms

1. **Conversation State Tracking**
   - Maintain a state machine for conversation (greeting, discussion, idle, etc.)
   - Different states have different priority rules
   - In "idle" state, lower priority inputs can trigger responses

2. **Multi-Threading Conversation**
   - Track multiple conversation threads simultaneously
   - Acknowledge interruptions with intent to return to previous topics
   - Example: "I'll get back to the music question in a moment"

3. **Memory and Continuity**
   - Maintain short-term memory of dropped conversation threads
   - Return to interrupted topics with natural transitions
   - "Getting back to what we were discussing earlier about..."

4. **Category-Based Response Profiles**
   - **Just Chatting**: Optimize for social interaction, focus on streamer and chat
   - **Gaming**: Provide game-relevant comments, recognize game events
   - **Watching Videos/Reactions**: Comment on content, share observations about what's being watched

5. **Contextual Silence Periods**
   - Recognize situations where silence is appropriate (intense gameplay, focused reading, emotional content)
   - Increase response threshold during these periods
   - Respect the natural flow of the stream

6. **Conversational Cadence Modeling**
   - Track the natural rhythm of conversation to avoid over-responding
   - Build in "breathing room" between responses
   - Implement variable delays based on conversation intensity

## Response Appropriateness

1. **Channel-Appropriate Responses**
   - Twitch chat responses: More concise and public-friendly
   - Direct microphone questions: More conversational and personal
   - Visual observations: Casual mentions rather than formal reports

2. **Context-Aware Language Models**
   - Use different prompt patterns based on input source
   - Example: Prefix Twitch inputs with "A viewer asks:" vs. microphone with "You asked:"
   - Shapes how the model frames its response

3. **Social Awareness**
   - Recognize engagement with others through visual/audio cues
   - Reduce interruptions during detected conversations with others
   - Increase activity during solo periods

4. **Dynamic Knowledge Integration**
   - For gaming: Fetch game summaries, mechanics, and terminology when switching games
   - For reaction content: Get context about content type being watched
   - Create temporary "expertise layers" for different contexts

5. **Non-Verbal Acknowledgment**
   - Consider methods to "acknowledge" without full responses
   - Could be implemented through subtle audio cues or visual indicators
   - Shows attention without interruption

6. **Intent Classification**
   - Categorize detected inputs by intent (question, statement, ambient noise, etc.)
   - Only respond to specific intent types in certain contexts
   - Distinguish between direct address and ambient conversation

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Attention Management**
   - Central "attention manager" evaluates all inputs to decide focus
   - Scoring system weighs recency, relevance, source priority, and novelty

2. **Topic Modeling**
   - Use lightweight topic extraction to connect related inputs across time and sources
   - Maintain coherent conversation despite multiple input channels

3. **Feedback Loops**
   - Use engagement patterns to tune priorities
   - If you regularly respond to certain observations, increase their priority

4. **Attention Distribution Logic**
   - Context-specific focus allocation:
     - Just Chatting: 50% mic, 40% chat, 10% visual
     - Gaming: 60% visual, 20% mic, 20% chat
     - Reaction Content: 70% content audio/visual, 15% mic, 15% chat

5. **Transition Handling**
   - Acknowledge category changes naturally
   - Example: "I see we're switching to gameplay now..."
   - Smooth between different contextual frames

6. **Game/Content Profiles**
   - Build knowledge bases for commonly played games or watched content
   - Develop longer-term understanding of preferences within specific categories
   - Recall previous sessions in similar contexts

7. **Audience Awareness**
   - Respond less frequently when there's active chat engagement
   - Be more active during quieter periods to maintain stream energy
   - Recognize when viewers are responding to questions you might answer

8. **Content Relevance Filtering**
   - Evaluate potential responses for how much value they add
   - Filter out low-information or obvious observations
   - Only interject with genuinely insightful or helpful contributions

9. **Topic Saturation Detection**
   - Track how much has already been said about a particular topic
   - Avoid repeating similar observations about recurring visual elements
   - Decrease response probability for well-covered topics
